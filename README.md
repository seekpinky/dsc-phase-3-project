FlatIron Phase 3 Project : H1N1 Vaccines
# Business Problem
New York State Department of Health wants to increase H1N1 vaccination rate.New York Department of Health wants to increase future public health effort to increase public vaccination rate by having an understanding of how peopleâ€™s backgrounds, opinions, and health behaviors are related to their personal vaccination patterns.
# Identifying Features and Target and investigate the non vaccinate group
3 EDA analysis was done w unvaccinated group w education level, H1N1 concern level, H1N1 risk opinion.
#Data Undestanding and Identifying Features and Target
Give an introudction of what each feature stand for.
#Train /Test split with 75%-25% data before we do anything.
Data preprocessing and imputing missing value for data
impute data with different startegies and drop data that are not used in this prediction.
# Pipeline
set up different pipe for categorical ordinal variables, categorical nominal variables and numerical variables.
use column transformers to apply to which columns need to be transformed.
# Models n fine tuning w hyper parameter
Baseline model and 4 different models were evaluated in this model
4 models are logistic regression, KNN neighbors,Decision Tree, and AdaBoost
KNN neighbors,Decision Tree, and AdaBoost are also fined tuned with GridSearch to provide optimum paramters.
# Model Evaluation.
Model is evaluated based on accuracy and precision score. Logistic Regression Model turns to be the best model in this study.
Top 10 important features is discussed for the logistic regression model.
# Recommendation:
Provide H1n1 risk awareness to the college education group.
# Future work:
Develop study on employment and H1N1 vaccine and use more complexed models for prediction.
