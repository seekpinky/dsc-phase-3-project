    "In general, the smaller K is, the tighter the \"fit\" of the model. Remember that with supervised learning, you want to fit a model to the data as closely as possible without overfitting to patterns in the training set that don't generalize. This can happen if your model pays too much attention to every little detail and makes a very complex decision boundary. Conversely, if your model is overly simplistic, then you may have underfit the model, limiting its potential. A visual explanation helps demonstrate this concept in practice:"
