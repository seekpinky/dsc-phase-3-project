    "Everyone know about H1N1 disease, but people are not highly concerned about it. People with chronical medical condition, have seasonal vaccine, who is a health worker, and with children under 6 months are in the top 10 highest feature scores for the Logistic Regression prediction. It shows that if people are aware of their health condition, they are highly going to get vaccinated. From our EDA analysis,there is a lot of people doesnt think H1N1 are risky without vaccination. Therefore, even they are some concerns about H1N1, but they are not vaccinated as they don't think its risky with vaccination. I would suggest we target people with high educational group about the H1N1 risk to boost the H1n1 vaccination rate."

Also, more complicated models such as Random Forrest should be used to investigate the data."
